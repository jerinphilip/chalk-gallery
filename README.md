# chalk-gallery

Repository containing one-off scripts rendering a few diagrams using
[chalk-diagrams/chalk](https://github.com/chalk-diagrams/chalk).


Expect horrible hardcodes, and bad practices, and abysmal documentation. This
is mostly trialling the declarative drawing API and developing a taste.
